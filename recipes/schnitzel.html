    <p>This Wiener Schnitzel is an easy Austrian recipe and one of our favorites. Boneless veal chops can also be substituted for pork or chicken and taste excellent!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds veal cutlets</1>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced parsley</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place veal cutlets between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound cutlets with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness. Dip cutlets in flour to coat; shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs, Parmesan cheese, milk, parsley, salt, pepper, and nutmeg together in a shallow bowl until combined. Place bread crumbs on a plate.</li>
        <li>Dip each cutlet into the egg mixture, then press in bread crumbs to coat. Place coated cutlets on a plate and refrigerate for 1 hour to overnight.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook breaded cutlets in butter until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to a serving platter and pour pan juices over them. Garnish with lemon slices.</li>
        <li>Eat.</li>
    </ol>
